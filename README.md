Introduction to Project:

> IPL Analytics Dashboard is a web application that provides users with the ability to analyze IPL match data from 2008 to 2022.
> The project uses the latest technologies such as Spring Batch, Spring Boot, React JS, and REST API to provide a modern and efficient user experience.


Frontend:

> The frontend of the IPL Analytics Dashboard is built using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> The frontend provides users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with the data.

Backend:

> The backend of the IPL Analytics Dashboard is built using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications.
> The backend provides REST API endpoints that the frontend can use to fetch and manipulate data.
> The backend also includes Spring Batch, a framework for batch processing that is used to load and process large amounts of data.

Working:

> The IPL Analytics Dashboard works by fetching data from a data source using Spring Batch and storing it in a database.
> The frontend then interacts with the backend through REST API endpoints to fetch and manipulate the data.
